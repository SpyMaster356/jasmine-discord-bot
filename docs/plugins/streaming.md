## Usage

To set or change the role given to users use the following command:
```
!config streaming setLiveRole {role}
```

By default, Jasmine will add the live role to any user who goes live. To change this, you use the following command to 
restrict it to a user with a special Streamer role. The same command can be also be used to change the role.
```
!config streaming setStreamerRole {role}
```

If you no longer want to restrict who gets the live role:
```
!config streaming removeStreamerRole
```
